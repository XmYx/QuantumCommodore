# Brain‑Inspired DIY Photonic Quantum Computer idea that if shows potential, might be worth it to build, fix and test.

Welcome! This project brings together optics, electronics, and a dash of neuroscience-inspired thinking to explore quantum computing—right on your workbench. While we’re not (yet) rewriting cryptography or simulating chemistry at scale, this setup lets you build, control, and observe photon‑based qubits in a warm, room‑temperature environment.

## ✨ Why This Project Matters

- **Accessibility**: No cryogenics required—just off‑the‑shelf optics, an Arduino (or equivalent), and a USB interface.
- **Longevity**: Inspired by the brain’s hypothetical quantum strategies, we use continuous refresh cycles and error correction to extend coherence times far beyond typical DIY demos.
- **Learning Platform**: Perfect for students, hobbyists, and curious minds. Dive into quantum optics, signal processing, and active error correction.

## 🔧 What You’ll Build

1. **Optical Bench**  
   - Polarizing beam splitters, waveplates, fiber couplers  
   - Single‑photon source and detectors  
2. **Control Electronics**  
   - Arduino/Teensy firmware for nanosecond timing  
   - USB‑serial bridge for real‑time feedback  
3. **Software Stack**  
   - Python control scripts for automated refresh & error correction  
   - Visualization dashboard for state monitoring

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Gather Parts**  
   See [COMPONENTS.md](COMPONENTS.md) for a detailed shopping list and estimated costs.
2. **Assemble Optics**  
   Carefully align sources, beam splitters, and detectors. Patience is key!
3. **Flash Firmware**  
   Upload `firmware/quantum_controller.ino` to your microcontroller.
4. **Install Software**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python setup.py install
````

5. **Run the Demo**

   ```bash
   python examples/quantum_randomness.py
   ```

   Watch your first live quantum random numbers on the dashboard!

## 🌱 How It Works

* **Quantum Zeno Refresh**
  Frequent weak measurements “freeze” qubit states, mimicking neuronal refresh cycles.
* **Topological Protection**
  Geometric‑phase gates add robustness against small alignment errors.
* **Active Error Correction**
  Real‑time syndrome detection and feed‑forward correction keep coherence ticking.
